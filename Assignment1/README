make - compile this project folder only
*make all - compile the entire project
*make run - run the program
*make clean - clean the entire project

* - use these rules here

Makefiles in /libs/databaselib and /libs/menuinterfacelib folders:
make - compile this folder only
make clean - clean this folder only

Explanation of what each file does and how it fits into the program as a whole:

Database.cpp & Database.h - These source and header files represents the database engine - implementing all 
			the database functionality such as: adding a student (or overwriting existing student),
			reading (viewing) the database, saving (writing to) the database, displaying student's data
			and grading student. It also processes the menu choice selected by the user and passes it to
			the above methods.

MenuInterface.cpp /& MenuInterface.h - These source and header files represents the simple menu-based interface - displaying
					it, as well as clearing the terminal (console) window.

Driver.cpp - This driver source file contains the main function (entry point to the program). It sets up the database from 
	information stored in database.txt and reads menu options continuously, getting user input menu choice. It also exits
	from the application if the termination condition 'q' is selected (to quit).

database.txt - This file contains the database of student records in the following text format: <name> <surname> <student number> <class record>.
